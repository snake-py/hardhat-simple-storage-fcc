# hardhat-simple-storage-fcc

This project is about learning the fundamentals with the hardhat framework. It is a simple smart contract that stores a value and allows the owner to update it. And then we wrote a deploy script and installed a nodejs compiler (solc) to compile the smart contract.

## How the deployment of a smart contract works:

1. We compile the smart contract

    a) over solcjs inside terminal

    b) over solc as a a script

    c) over another compiler

2. We deploy the smart contract

    Connect to the blockchain therefore you need to get the rpc endpoint, either you own node (ether-go) or a third party (e.g. infura). With ganache it is eihter http://127.0.0.1:7545 or http://127.0.0.1:8545
