# Hardhat Simple Storage

This project is about learning the fundamentals with the hardhat framework. It is a simple smart contract that stores a value and allows the owner to update it.

## Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

The contracts were deployed to the Goerli testnet. You can verify them by running:

```shell
npx hardhat verify --network goerli
```

Contract Addresses:

```shell
0x88caac30366Ac88aCD972bdCD551842875F1950a
0x1e627e2161840Fe060e6DE6318F072a803271471
```
